        "description": "academy award-nominated director michael verhoeven unearths the long-buried truth about nazi germany in this documentary exploring the wehrmacht exhibition - a controversial display consisting of personal letters, photographs, and film footage that implicate common foot soldiers in some of the most horrific atrocities ever committed against mankind. when most folks think of world war ii, names like hitler, himmler, and eichmann offer a comforting means of confining evil to a relative few: but what of the countless soldiers who carried out their diabolical plans - aren't they just as much to blame for the horrors that we read about in our history books? despite the fact that the sons and grandsons of these soldiers have refuted the damning evidence that vilifies their forefathers, the fact remains that the nazi leaders couldn't have cemented their terrifying stronghold over europe without some serious backup, and as verhoeven and his crew travel to the killing fields of the eastern front while speaking with historians, experts, soldiers, and eyewitnesses, the viewer bears witness to an insecure nation's desperate attempts to reconcile its proud history and dark legacy. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "a mind-bending sci-fi symphony, stanley kubrick's landmark 1968 epic pushed the limits of narrative and special effects toward a meditation on technology and humanity. based on arthur c. clarke's story the sentinel, kubrick and clarke's screenplay is structured in four movements. at the \"dawn of man,\" a group of hominids encounters a mysterious black monolith alien to their surroundings. to the strains of strauss's 1896 also sprach zarathustra, a hominid invents the first weapon, using a bone to kill prey. as the hominid tosses the bone in the air, kubrick cuts to a 21st century spacecraft hovering over the earth, skipping ahead millions of years in technological development. u.s. scientist dr. heywood floyd (william sylvester) travels to the moon to check out the discovery of a strange object on the moon's surface: a black monolith. as the sun's rays strike the stone, however, it emits a piercing, deafening sound that fills the investigators' headphones and stops them in their path. cutting ahead 18 months, impassive astronauts david bowman (keir dullea) and frank poole (gary lockwood) head toward jupiter on the spaceship discovery, their only company three hibernating astronauts and the vocal, man-made hal 9000 computer running the entire ship. when the all-too-human hal malfunctions, however, he tries to murder the astronauts to cover his error, forcing bowman to defend himself the only way he can. free of hal, and finally informed of the voyage's purpose by a recording from floyd, bowman journeys to \"jupiter and beyond the infinite,\" through the psychedelic slit-scan star-gate to an 18th century room, and the completion of the monolith's evolutionary mission.with assistance from special-effects expert douglas trumbull, kubrick spent over two years meticulously creating the most \"realistic\" depictions of outer space ever seen, greatly advancing cinematic technology for a story expressing grave doubts about technology itself. despite some initial critical reservations that it was too long and too dull, 2001 became one of the most popular films of 1968, underlining the generation gap between young moviegoers who wanted to see something new and challenging and oldsters who \"didn't get it.\" provocatively billed as \"the ultimate trip,\" 2001 quickly caught on with a counterculture youth audience open to a contemplative (i.e. chemically enhanced) viewing experience of a film suggesting that the way to enlightenment was to free one's mind of the u.s. military-industrial-technological complex. ~ lucia bozzola, rovi",

        "description": "sin city author frank miller's sweeping take on the historic battle of thermopylae comes to the screen courtesy of dawn of the dead director zack snyder. gerard butler stars as spartan king leonidas and lena headey plays queen gorgo. the massive army of the persian empire is sweeping across the globe, crushing every force that dares stand in its path. when a persian envoy arrives in sparta offering king leonidas power over all of greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful xerxes (rodrigo santoro), the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire's best fighters and marches off to battle. though they have virtually no hope of defeating xerxes' intimidating battalion, leonidas' men soldier on, intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. meanwhile, back in sparta, the loyal queen gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious theron (dominic west) to send more troops despite the fact that many view leonidas' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. as xerxes' fearsome \"immortals\" draw near, a few noble greeks vow to assist the spartans on the battlefield. when king leonidas and his 300 spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming persian army at the battle of thermopylae, the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of greece to stand up against their persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "this spoof of the airport series of disaster movies relies on ridiculous sight gags, groan-inducing dialogue, and deadpan acting -- a comedy style that would be imitated for the next 20 years. airplane! pulls out all the cliches as alcoholic pilot ted striker (robert hays), who's developed a fear of flying due to wartime trauma, boards a jumbo jet in an attempt to woo back his stewardess girlfriend (julie hagerty). food poisoning decimates the passengers and crew, leaving it up to striker to land the plane, with the help of a glue-sniffing air traffic controller (lloyd bridges) and striker's vengeful former captain (robert stack), who must both talk him down. along the way, we meet a clutch of stock disaster movie passengers like the guitar-strumming nun, a sick little girl, a frightened old lady, and two african-american travelers whose \"jive\" has to be subtitled. leslie nielsen portrays the plane's doctor, launching a new phase of the actor's career that carried him through the next two decades in several similarly comedic roles. the trio of directors jim abrahams, jerry zucker, and david zucker responsible for the film would eventually go on to solo careers, but not before making top secret! and ruthless people. ~ perry seibert, rovi",

        "description": "in 1977, george lucas released star wars, the ultimate sci-fi popcorn flick-turned-pop-culture myth machine. it quickly became the biggest money-making film of all time and changed the shape of the film industry. after two successful sequels (1980's the empire strikes back and 1983's return of the jedi) that extended the story of the first film, lucas took some time off to produce movies for others, with mixed success. in 1999, lucas returned to the star wars saga with a new approach -- instead of picking up where return of the jedi left off, star wars: episode i -- the phantom menace would be the first of a trilogy of stories to trace what happened in the intergalactic saga before the first film began. here, obi-wan kenobi (ewan mcgregor) is a young apprentice jedi knight under the tutelage of qui-gon jinn (liam neeson); anakin skywalker (jake lloyd), who will later father luke skywalker and become known as darth vader, is just a nine-year-old boy. when the trade federation cuts off all routes to the planet naboo, qui-gon and obi-wan are assigned to settle the matter, but when they arrive on naboo they are brought to amidala (natalie portman), the naboo queen, by a friendly but opportunistic gungan named jar jar. qui-gon and obi-wan plan to escort amidala to a meeting of republic leaders in coruscant, but trouble with their spacecraft strands them on the planet tatooine, where qui-gon meets anakin, the slave of a scrap dealer. qui-gon is soon convinced that the boy could be the leader the jedis have been searching for, and he begins bargaining for his freedom and teaching the boy the lessons of the force. the supporting cast includes pernilla august as anakin's mother, terence stamp as chancellor valorum, and samuel l. jackson as jedi master mace windu. jackson told a reporter before the phantom menace's release that the best part about doing the film was that he got to say \"may the force be with you\" onscreen. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "one of a cluster of late-1970s films about the vietnam war, francis ford coppola's apocalypse now adapts the joseph conrad novella heart of darkness to depict the war as a descent into primal madness. capt. willard (martin sheen), already on the edge, is assigned to find and deal with awol col. kurtz (marlon brando), rumored to have set himself up in the cambodian jungle as a local, lethal godhead. along the way willard encounters napalm and wagner fan col. kilgore (robert duvall), draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs, a uso playboy bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers, and a jumpy photographer (dennis hopper) telling wild, reverent tales about kurtz. by the time willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near kurtz's compound, he knows kurtz has gone over the deep end, but it is uncertain whether willard himself now agrees with kurtz's insane dictum to \"drop the bomb. exterminate them all.\" coppola himself was not certain either, and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press, the palme d'or-winning \"work-in-progress\" shown at cannes, and the final 35 mm u.s. release (also the ending on the video cassette). the chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and coppola covered the overages himself. these production headaches, which coppola characterized as being like the vietnam war itself, have been superbly captured in the documentary, hearts of darkness: a filmmaker's apocalypse. despite the studio's fears and mixed reviews of the film's ending, apocalypse now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight academy awards, including best picture, best director, best supporting actor for duvall's psychotic kilgore, and best screenplay. it won oscars for sound and for vittorio storaro's cinematography. this hallucinatory, wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made, and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the vietnam era. ~ lucia bozzola, rovi",

        "description": "\"houston, we have a problem.\" those words were immortalized during the tense days of the apollo 13 lunar mission crisis in 1970, events recreated in this epic historical drama from ron howard. astronaut jim lovell (tom hanks) leads command module pilot jack swigert (kevin bacon) and lunar module driver fred haise (bill paxton) on what is slated as nasa's third lunar landing mission. all goes smoothly until the craft is halfway through its mission, when an exploding oxygen tank threatens the crew's oxygen and power supplies. as the courageous astronauts face the dilemma of either suffocating or freezing to death, mattingly and mission control leader gene kranz (ed harris) struggle to find a way to bring the crew back home, all the while knowing that the spacemen face probable death once the battered ship reenters the earth's atmosphere. the film received an overwhelmingly enthusiastic critical response and a best picture nomination, but lost that oscar to another (very different) historical epic, mel gibson's braveheart. in 2002, the movie was released in imax theaters as apollo 13: the imax experience, with a pared-down running time of 116 minutes in order to meet the technical requirements of the large-screen format. ~ don kaye, rovi",

        "description": "the origins of the caped crusader of gotham city are finally brought to the big screen in this new adaptation of the perennially popular comic-book series. the young bruce wayne (gus lewis) leads a privileged life as the son of wealthy, philanthropist parents, both of whom stress their commitment to improving the lives of the citizens of crime-ridden gotham city. after his mother and father are murdered by a mugger, however, wayne grows into an impudent young man (christian bale), full of rage and bent on retribution until encouraged by his childhood sweetheart, rachel dawes (katie holmes), to search for answers beyond his own personal vendettas. wayne eventually finds discipline in the far east under the tutelage of henri ducard (liam neeson), a member of the mysterious league of shadows who guides him in the study of martial arts -- and the ways in which an ordinary man can hone his senses to an almost superhuman acuity. after seven years away from gotham, wayne returns, determined to bring peace and safety back to the city. with the help of his faithful manservant, alfred pennyworth (michael caine), and lucius fox (morgan freeman), a scientist at his late father's corporation, wayne develops a secret identity as batman, a masked fighter for justice. but when a shady psychiatrist (cillian murphy) joins forces with the criminal underworld, wayne realizes that putting an end to their nefarious plans will be very difficult indeed. batman begins also features gary oldman as lt. james gordon and tom wilkinson as the crime boss carmine falcone. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "a blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, blade runner (1982) was a box office and critical bust upon its initial exhibition, but its unique postmodern production design became hugely influential within the sci-fi genre, and the film gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. harrison ford stars as rick deckard, a retired cop in los angeles circa 2019. l.a. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the tyrell corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. called before his one-time superior (m. emmett walsh), deckard is forced back into active duty. a quartet of replicants led by roy batty (rutger hauer) has escaped and headed to earth, killing several humans in the process. after meeting with the eccentric eldon tyrell (joe turkel), creator of the replicants, deckard finds and eliminates zhora (joanna cassidy), one of his targets. attacked by another replicant, leon (brion james), deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by rachael (sean young), tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. in the meantime, batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, pris (darryl hannah) use a dying inventor, j.f. sebastian (william sanderson) to get close to tyrell and murder him. deckard tracks the pair to sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between deckard and batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. in 1992, ridley scott released a popular director's cut that removed deckard's narration, added a dream sequence, and excised a happy ending imposed by the results of test screenings; these legendary behind-the-scenes battles were chronicled in a 1996 tome, future noir: the making of blade runner by paul m. sammon. ~ karl williams, rovi",

        "description": "combining hi-8 video with black-and-white 16 mm film, this film presents a raw look at what can happen when college students forego common sense and enter the world of voodoo and witchcraft. presented as a straightforward documentary, the film opens with a title card explaining that in 1994, three students went into the maryland back woods to do a film project on the blair witch incidents. these kids were never seen again, and the film you are about to see is from their recovered equipment, found in the woods a year later. the entire movie documents their adventures leading up to their final minutes. the blair witch incident, as we initially learn from the local town elders, is an old legend about a group of witches who tortured and killed several children many years ago. everyone in town knows the story and they're all sketchy on the details. out in the woods and away from their parked car (and civilization), what starts as a school exercise turns into a nightmare when the three kids lose their map. forced to spend extra days finding their way out, the kids then start to hear horrific sounds outside their tents in the pitch-black middle of night. they also find strange artifacts from (what can only be) the blair witch, still living in the woods. frightened, they desperately try to find their way out of the woods, with no luck. slowly these students start to unravel, knowing they have no way of getting out, no food, and it's getting cold. each night they are confronted with shrieking and sounds so haunting that they are convinced someone is following them, and they quickly begin to fear for their lives. the film premiered in the midnight movie section at the 1999 sundance film festival. ~ chris gore, rovi",

        "description": "director tim burton brings his unique vision and sensibility to roald dahl's classic children's story in this lavish screen interpretation. willy wonka (johnny depp) is the secretive and wildly imaginative man behind the world's most celebrated candy company, and while the wonka factory is famously closed to visitors, the reclusive candy man decides to give five lucky children a chance to see the inside of his operation by placing \"golden tickets\" in five randomly selected chocolate bars. charlie bucket (freddie highmore), whose poor but loving family lives literally in the shadow of the wonka factory, is lucky enough to obtain one of the tickets, and charlie, escorted by his grandpa joe (david kelly), is in for the ride of a lifetime as he tours the strange and remarkable world of wonka with fellow winners, media-obsessed mike teavee (jordan fry), harsh and greedy veruca salt (julia winter), gluttonous augustus gloop (philip wiegratz), and ultra-competitive violet beauregarde (annasophia robb). over the course of the day, some of the children will learn difficult lessons about themselves, and one will go on to become wonka's new right hand. charlie and the chocolate factory also stars christopher lee, james fox, and noah taylor; the book was famously adapted to the screen before in 1971 under the title willy wonka and the chocolate factory, with gene wilder as the eccentric candy tycoon. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "a starry-eyed would-be star discovers just how far the notion that \"there's no such thing as bad publicity\" can go in this screen adaptation of the hit broadway musical chicago, originally directed and choreographed by bob fosse. in the mid-'20s, roxie hart (renee zellweger) is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named amos (john c. reilly). roxie is having an affair on the side with fred casley (dominic west), a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. however, fred strings roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders fred in cold blood. roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside velma kelly (catherine zeta-jones), a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron \"mama\" morton hooks velma up with hotshot lawyer billy flynn (richard gere), velma becomes the new queen of the scandal sheets. roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces amos to also hire flynn. soon flynn is splashing roxie's story -- or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of roxie's story -- all over the gutter press, and roxy and velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines. a project that had been moving from studio to studio since the musical opened on broadway in 1973, chicago also features guest appearances by lucy liu and christine baranski. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "this disney animated version of cinderella took the somewhat violent tale of a downtrodden young woman who uses her wits, her beauty, her goodness and a little magical intervention to rise above adversity to become a princess, and changed the story into a syrupy sweet tale in which she does nothing more than look pretty, and passively do as she is told to achieve her dreams. that said, this beautifully animated, tuneful version is still a favorite among disney fans as it follows the good-hearted cinderella as she bravely endures the abuse and humiliation of her evil and ugly stepmother and step-sisters. naturally when the great royal ball, during which the prince is to choose a bride, is held, cinderella is not allowed to attend. the sisters tell her it is because she has no gown. in true disney fashion, when all the local mice and birds see the girl who has been so kind to them weeping, they gather together and make her a dress. unfortunately, the sisters find it and destroy it, leaving the heartbroken maiden alone and saddled with many chores on the night of the grand fete. fortunately, her sorrow attracts the attention of a beneficent fairy godmother who with a merry \"bibbidi bobbidi boo\" and a wave of her wand, creates for cinderella a fabulous gown and glorious carriage to take her to the ball. of course there is the matter of being home at midnight when the spell is to wear off. cinderella listens and goes to the ball, falls for the prince and has a marvelous time until the clock begins striking the final hour. hastily she departs, accidentally leaving one impossibly tiny (heaven forbid a hard-working chambermaid have large, ungainly and infinitely practical feet!) glass slipper behind. the besotted prince, desperate to find his mystery love orders a kingdom-wide search and of course, the story ends on an eternally blissful note.",

        "description": "the top gun team of producers don simpson and jerry bruckheimer, director tony scott, and superstar tom cruise reunite for this excursion into stock-car racing that incorporates the vroom and rumble of deafening car engines with a rehash of the same elements that worked so effectively in cruise's top gun, the color of money, and cocktail. cruise plays stock-car driver cole trickle, a young fireball on the southern stock-car circuit who has loads of talent but no conception of how to channel that talent in to racing success. when tim daland (randy quaid) commissions veteran stock-car racer harry hogge (robert duvall) to built a car and hires cole to drive it, harry must instill in cole his philosophy of winning and teach him how to channel his raw talent into success -- or, as harry puts it, \"controlling something that's out of control.\" cole immediately comes into conflict with the circuit's star driver, rowdy burns (michael rooker), and their hijinks on the track causes them to smash up their cars and lands them both in the hospital. because of his injuries, rowdy is forced to withdraw from the circuit competition. with no rival to torment, rowdy becomes cole's supporter and friend, while cole revs up his motors for dr. claire lewicki (nicole kidman), the attractive brain specialist who supervises cole's recovery from the crackup. cole's health is restored, and he begins to race again, chastened and hanging onto harry's every word. cole appears to have centered himself for success, but in an orgasmic grand finale, cole must compete against russ wheeler (cary elwes), a dastardly driver who not only wants to see cole defeated but permanently disabled. ~ paul brenner, rovi",

        "description": "mimi leder (the peacemaker) directed this science-fiction disaster drama about the possible extinction of human life after a comet is discovered headed toward earth with the collision only one year away. ambitious msnbc reporter jenny lerner (tea leoni) stumbles onto the story, prompting a white house press conference. united states president beck (morgan freeman) announces the government's solution: a team of astronauts will travel to the comet and destroy it. the team leader aboard the spaceship messiah is spurgeon tanner (robert duvall), who was once the last man to walk on the moon. however, the mission fails, splitting off a chunk of the comet, now due to land in the atlantic with the impact sending a 350-foot tidal wave flooding 650 miles inland, destroying new york and other cities. the larger part of the comet, hitting in canada, will trigger an e.l.e. (extinction level event), not unlike a \"nuclear winter\" as dust clouds block out the sun and bring life to an end. president beck reveals plan b: a cavernous underground retreat constructed to hold one million americans, with most to be selected through a national lottery. since teenage amateur astronomer leo biederman (elijah wood) discovered the comet, his family gets a pass to enter the cave, but his girlfriend sarah (leelee sobieski) and her parents will be left behind. meanwhile, still in space, spurgeon tanner devises a plan for a kamikaze-styled operation that could possibly save the earth. special visual effects by scott farrar and industrial light & magic. ~ bhob stewart, rovi",

        "description": "the plot of this action film begins in 1996, with los angeles in a violence-crazed conflagration. one of the lapd's most notorious cops, john spartan (sylvester stallone), known as \"the demolition man,\" is in hot pursuit of blonde-haired psychopath simon phoenix (wesley snipes), who is so nasty he even kills sometimes just because he feels cranky. john captures simon, but not before simon kills innocent hostages. john is blamed for the deaths of the hostages, and both he and simon are cryogenically frozen to remove their brand of ultra-violence from a society that is simply just too violent. the film shifts to the future world of 2032, where los angeles has become a megalopolis called san angeles. there is no poverty, arnold schwarzenegger was (at one time) president of the united states, and taco bell is the sole survivor of the franchise wars. into this peaceful and bland society, simon is summarily defrosted by reigning benevolent dictator dr. cocteau (nigel hawthorne) to have simon murder edgar friendly (denis leary), the leader of a group of underground rebels. but cocteau bites off more than he can chew when the melted-down simon proceeds to go on a murder-and-looting spree. reluctantly, cocteau defrosts john to hunt down his old adversary. as john adjusts to self-driving cars and having sex wearing helmets, he pairs up with lenina huxley (sandra bullock), a bored cop with a nostalgic fascination for 20th-century culture. ~ paul brenner, rovi",

        "description": "a mysterious criminal mastermind has stolen one of the pyramids in egypt, sparking a fit of jealous envy in evil genius gru (steve carell), who hasn't managed to make headlines since he and his minions swiped the times square jumbotron years back. ever since gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. now, if gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the earth's satellite right out of the sky. but immediately after gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd vector (jason segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. now, in order to claim the moon, gru must first reacquire the weapon from vector. armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, gru adopts cookie-selling orphans margo (miranda cosgrove), agnes (elsie fisher), and edith (dana gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil dr. nefario (russell brand), his personal weapons specialist. but as gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. they actually seem to care about gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. when gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what's more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "based on the popular mystery play by frederick knott, dial m for murder is more talky and stagebound than most hitchcock films, but no less enjoyable. british tennis pro ray milland suspects that his wealthy wife grace kelly is fooling around with handsome american robert cummings. milland blackmails a disgraced former army comrade (anthony dawson) into murdering kelly and making it look like the work of a burglar. but milland's carefully mapped-out scheme does not take into account the notion that kelly might fight back and kill her assailant. when the police (represented by john williams) investigate, milland improvises quickly, subtly planting the suggestion that his wife has committed first-degree murder. he almost gets away with it; to tell you more would spoil the fun of the film's final thirty minutes. hitchcock claimed that he chose this single-set play because he was worn out from several earlier, more ambitious projects, and wanted to \"recharge his batteries.\" compelled by warner bros. to film dial m for murder in 3-d, hitchcock perversely refused to throw in the standard in-your-face gimmickry of most stereoscopic films of the era--though watch how he visually emphasizes an important piece of evidence towards the end of the film. ~ hal erickson, rovi",

        "description": "jim carrey and jeff daniels play the title roles (though viewers may find themselves debating which is which) in this genially low-brow comedy. lloyd christmas (jim carrey) and harry dunne (jeff daniels) are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place; the guys also have a certain problem (not difficult to understand) holding on to jobs. lloyd is working as a limo driver in rhode island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named mary swanson (lauren holly) who is being taken to the airport. lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. lloyd isn't able to get aboard mary's flight (though not for lack of trying). harry has a van decorated to look like a dog (to promote his failing dog-grooming business), and the pair hop in the poochmobile to find mary in aspen. what lloyd and harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. incidentally, lloyd's chipped front tooth happens to be real; while jim carrey had the injured tooth capped many years ago, he thought a broken smile would suit lloyd's character and had the cap removed for the duration of filming. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "both a classic movie for kids and a remarkable portrait of childhood, e.t. is a sci-fi adventure that captures that strange moment in youth when the world is a place of mysterious possibilities (some wonderful, some awful), and the universe seems somehow separate from the one inhabited by grown-ups. henry thomas plays elliott, a young boy living with his single mother (dee wallace), his older brother michael (robert macnaughton), and his younger sister gertie (drew barrymore). elliott often seems lonely and out of sorts, lost in his own world. one day, while looking for something in the back yard, he senses something mysterious in the woods watching him. and he's right: an alien spacecraft on a scientific mission mistakenly left behind an aging botanist who isn't sure how to get home. eventually elliott puts his fears aside and makes contact with the \"little squashy guy,\" perhaps the least threatening alien invader ever to hit a movie screen. as elliott tries to keep the alien under wraps and help him figure out a way to get home, he discovers that the creature can communicate with him telepathically. soon they begin to learn from each other, and elliott becomes braver and less threatened by life. e.t. rigs up a communication device from junk he finds around the house, but no one knows if he'll be rescued before a group of government scientists gets hold of him. in 2002, steven spielberg re-released e.t. the extra-terrestrial in a revised edition, with several deleted scenes restored and digitally refurbished special effects. ~ mark deming, rovi",

(first rule: don't talk about fight club. second rule: don't talk about fight club.) but as our narrator and tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when tyler becomes involved with marla (helena bonham carter), whom our narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit. based on the novel by chuck palahniuk, fight club was directed by david fincher, who previously directed pitt in the thriller seven. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "one of the longest-running horror film series began with this gory shocker from director sean s. cunningham, who had previously produced wes craven's classic last house on the left. entrepreneur steve christie (peter brouwer) re-opens camp crystal lake after many years during which it has been cursed by murders and bad luck. the young and nubile counselors all begin to die extremely bloody deaths at the hands of an unseen killer during a rainstorm which isolates the camp. a woman is chopped in the face with an axe, another has her throat sliced in amazingly gruesome fashion, a male counselor (harry crosby) is pinned to a door with arrows, and a young kevin bacon has an arrow shoved through his throat from below a bed. victor miller's script is not particularly impressive, but cunningham's tense direction, and some remarkable special-effects by acclaimed makeup artist tom savini are enough to make it worthwhile. 1950s quiz show regular betsy palmer appears as the cook whose son, jason (ari lehman), drowned 25 years earlier while neglected by romancing counselors. palmer was reportedly cast because she was willing to drive her own car to and from the set. trivia buffs should note the decapitation scene near the end, in which the female killer exhibits rather hirsute hands clutching at the air. the hands belong to savini's assistant, taso n. stavrakis. friday the 13th made nearly 40 million dollars at the box office and spawned numerous sequels. ~ robert firsching, rovi",

        "description": "in a futuristic society where commerce has overridden more humanistic concerns, the rich and successful, eager to obtain physical and mental perfection, have taken to genetically engineering their off-spring. such lab-created babies are known as valids, while those conceived in the normal, loving fashion are in-valids and are considered second-class citizens at best -- especially if they have birth defects. vincent (ethan hawke) is an in-valid while his brother anton (loren dean) is a valid. the former brother is short, sickly, and bespectacled, while the latter brother is handsome, healthy and born to succeed. but though anton seems close to perfection, he lacks the emotional flaws, passion, determination, desire and faith that motivate vincent, whose strongest desire is to become a space navigator for the gattaca aerospace corporation and travel on an upcoming mission to the moons of saturn. unfortunately, his birth status and a heart defect, relegate him to menial jobs. unwilling to abandon hope, vincent determinedly visits dna broker german (tony shalhoub) who is able to create false identities for similar in-valids. it is not an easy transformation but eventually vincent -- who thanks to the genetic contributions of paralyzed valid jerome morrow (jude law), becomes jerome while the wheel-chair bound donor becomes eugene -- finally enters gattaca for training. there he encounters a beautiful valid pilot, irene (uma thurman) whose defective heart prevents her from flying. irene's plight is a fate she passively accepts whereas vincent is willing to oppose and fight for what he wants. meanwhile, an increasingly complex relationship evolves between vincent/jerome and jerome/eugene. set in an oppressive, bureaucratic and chillingly plausible early-21st-century world, andrew niccol's sci-fi thriller differs from others in its focus on a morally ambiguous world and on characters rather than gizmos, technobabble and special effects.",

        "description": "gone with the wind boils down to a story about a spoiled southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. producer david o. selznick managed to expand this concept, and margaret mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7-million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. gone with the wind opens in april of 1861, at the palatial southern estate of tara, where scarlett o'hara (vivien leigh) hears that her casual beau ashley wilkes (leslie howard) plans to marry \"mealy mouthed\" melanie hamilton (olivia de havilland). despite warnings from her father (thomas mitchell) and her faithful servant mammy (hattie mcdaniel), scarlett intends to throw herself at ashley at an upcoming barbecue at twelve oaks. alone with ashley, she goes into a fit of histrionics, all of which is witnessed by roguish rhett butler (clark gable), the black sheep of a wealthy charleston family, who is instantly fascinated by the feisty, thoroughly self-centered scarlett: \"we're bad lots, both of us.\" the movie's famous action continues from the burning of atlanta (actually the destruction of a huge wall left over from king kong) through the now-classic closing line, \"frankly, my dear, i don't give a damn.\" holding its own against stiff competition (many consider 1939 to be the greatest year of the classical hollywood studios), gone with the wind won ten academy awards, including best picture, best director, best screenplay, best actress (vivien leigh), and best supporting actress (hattie mcdaniel, the first african-american to win an oscar). the film grossed nearly 192 million dollars, assuring that, just as he predicted, selznick's epitaph would be \"the man who made gone with the wind.\" ~ hal erickson, rovi",

        "description": "martin scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of nicolas pileggi's best-selling wiseguy, the true-life account of mobster and fbi informant henry hill. set to a true-to-period rock soundtrack, the story details the rise and fall of hill, a half-irish, half-sicilian new york kid who grows up idolizing the \"wise guys\" in his impoverished brooklyn neighborhood. he begins hanging around the mobsters, running errands and doing odd jobs until he gains the notice of local chieftain paulie cicero (paul sorvino), who takes him in as a surrogate son. as he reaches his teens, hill (ray liotta) is inducted into the world of petty crime, where he distinguishes himself as a \"stand-up guy\" by choosing jail time over ratting on his accomplices. from that moment on, he is a part of the family. along with his psychotic partner tommy (joe pesci), he rises through the ranks to become paulie's lieutenant; however, he quickly learns that, like his mentor jimmy (robert deniro), his ethnicity prevents him from ever becoming a \"made guy,\" an actual member of the crime family. soon he finds himself the target of both the feds and the mobsters, who feel that he has become a threat to their security with his reckless dealings. goodfellas was rewarded with six academy award nominations including best picture; pesci would walk away with best supporting actor for his work. ~ jeremy beday, rovi",

        "description": "promoted as a family musical by paramount pictures, willy wonka and the chocolate factory is more of a black comedy, perversely faithful to the spirit of roald dahl's original book charlie and the chocolate factory. enigmatic candy manufacturer willy wonka (gene wilder) stages a contest by hiding five golden tickets in five of his scrumptious candy bars. whoever comes up with these tickets will win a free tour of the wonka factory, as well as a lifetime supply of candy. four of the five winning children are insufferable brats: the fifth is a likeable young lad named charlie bucket (peter ostrum), who takes the tour in the company of his equally amiable grandfather (jack albertson). in the course of the tour, willy wonka punishes the four nastier children in various diabolical methods -- one kid is inflated and covered with blueberry dye, another ends up as a principal ingredient of the chocolate, and so on -- because these kids have violated the ethics of wonka's factory. in the end, only charlie and his grandfather are left. ostensibly set in england, willy wonka and the chocolate factory was lensed in germany (as revealed by the film's final overhead shot). ~ hal erickson, rovi",

        "description": "directed by mike newell, the fourth installment to the harry potter series finds harry (daniel radcliffe) wondering why his legendary scar -- the famous result of a death curse gone wrong -- is aching in pain, and perhaps even causing mysterious visions. before he can think too much about it, however, harry boards the train to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, where he will attend his fourth year of magical education. shortly after his reunion with his best friends, ron (rupert grint) and hermione (emma watson), harry is introduced to yet another defense against the dark arts teacher: the grizzled mad-eye moody (brendan gleeson), a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous \"dada\" professorship as a personal favor to headmaster dumbledore (michael gambon). of course, harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student cedric diggory (robert pattinson), as hogwarts' representative in the tri-wizard tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community. as difficult as it is to deal with his schoolwork, friendships, and the tournament at the same time (not to mention his feelings toward the ever unfathomable professor snape (alan rickman), harry doesn't realize that the most feared wizard in the world, lord voldemort, is anticipating the tournament, as well. ~ tracie cooper, rovi",

        "description": "in this remake of william castle's campy 1958 classic, an eccentric millionaire named steven price invites a diverse group of people to a reputedly haunted mansion that was formerly the site of an insane asylum. steven offers his guests $1,000,000 each if they can spend the entire night at the old house without fleeing in terror. it sounds simple enough, but when those stories about ghosts haunting the mansion turn out to be true, the guests may no longer opt to stick around. in this version, steven is played by geoffrey rush, and his guests include jeffrey combs, taye diggs, peter gallagher, chris kattan, and bridgette wilson; famke janssen plays evelyn price. sadly, this remake does not feature the original's memorable special-effects gimmick, \"emergo,\" an inflatable plastic skeleton that rolled on wires through the theater during showings.",

        "description": "two new yorkers fight the battle of the sexes to a standstill (without entirely realizing it) in this romantic comedy. andie (kate hudson) is a young journalist who longs to cover political stories, but in the meantime she finds herself writing for a women's magazine called composure, where her editor lana jong (bebe neuwirth) has her writing a fluffy advice column. after hearing of the latest dating laments of her relationship-challenged friend michelle (kathryn hahn), andie sells lana on the idea of writing a piece on the things women do to alienate the men they love, which she'll demonstrate by winning and then driving away a man in a mere ten days. meanwhile, ben (matthew mcconaughey) is an advertising man who wants to land a prestige diamond account at his firm. ben is competing with his pals, spears (michael michele) and green (shalom harlow), for the assignment, so ben tells his boss phillip warren (robert klein) that he's the man for the job because he understands the fair sex so well he can make any woman fall for him in less than two weeks. as fate would have it, andie and ben end up choosing one another for their mutual assignments, with neither knowing about each other's secret agenda as ben strives to hold on to andie while she does everything in her power to annoy him. how to lose a guy in 10 days was loosely based on the self-help book of the same name (subtitled the universal don't of dating) written by michele alexander and jeannie long. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "the second of the george lucas/steven spielberg indiana jones epics is set a year or so before the events in raiders of the lost ark (1984). after a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging himalyan river, indy (harrison ford) gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote east indian village. his companions this time around include a dimbulbed, easily frightened nightclub chanteuse (kate capshaw), and a feisty 12-year-old kid named short round (quan ke huy). throughout, the plot takes second place to the thrills, which include a harrowing rollercoaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and indy's rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. there are also a couple of cute references to raiders of the lost ark, notably a funny variation of indy's shooting of the sherpa warrior. ~ hal erickson, rovi",

        "description": "based on peter benchley's best-selling novel, steven spielberg's 1975 shark saga set the standard for the new hollywood popcorn blockbuster while frightening millions of moviegoers out of the water. one early summer night on fictional atlantic resort amity island, chrissie decides to take a moonlight skinny dip while her friends party on the beach. yanked suddenly below the ocean surface, she never returns. when pieces of her wash ashore, police chief brody (roy scheider) suspects the worst, but mayor vaughn (murray hamilton), mindful of the lucrative tourist trade and the approaching july 4th holiday, refuses to put the island on a business-killing shark alert. after the shark dines on a few more victims, the mayor orders the local fishermen to catch the culprit. satisfied with the shark they find, the greedy mayor reopens the beaches, despite the warning from visiting ichthyologist hooper (richard dreyfuss) that the attacks were probably caused by a far more formidable great white. one more fatality later, brody and hooper join forces with flinty old salt quint (robert shaw), the only local fisherman willing to take on a great white--especially since the price is right. the three ride off on quint's boat \"the orca,\" soon coming face to teeth with the enemy. ~ lucia bozzola, rovi",

        "description": "following up his blockbuster action hit mr. and mrs. smith, director doug liman turns to an entirely new genre -- sci-fi -- for this tale of an underground world of teleporters. based on the novel by steven gould, jumper concerns david (hayden christensen), a young man who quite literally wills himself away from his grim family life by teleporting to another place with the power of his mind. years later, david is using his powers to raid bank vaults, seduce girls in london, lunch on the pyramids, and surf in fiji. but he soon discovers that he is not the only one bestowed with this unique gift, and all is not well in the world of jumpers. there are people out there, such as roland (samuel l. jackson), who view jumpers as a threat to all humankind, and have made it their mission in life to eliminate them. after jumping back to michigan to get reacquainted with his long lost love, millie (rachel bilson), david makes the acquaintance of experienced jumper griffin (jamie bell). informed by griffin of a secret between jumpers and a shadowy group that seeks to destroy them, the pair soon finds themselves facing off against a legion of murderous opponents who won't stop fighting until every last jumper has been eliminated. ~ michael hastings, rovi",

        "description": "as visually stylish as it is graphically violent, this thriller directed by luc besson concerns mathilda (natalie portman), a 12-year-old girl living in new york city who has been exposed to the sordid side of life from an early age: her family lives in a slum and her abusive father works for drug dealers, cutting and storing dope. mathilda doesn't much care for her parents, but she has a close bond with her four-year-old brother. one day, she returns from running an errand to discover that most of her family, including her brother, have been killed in a raid by corrupt dea agents, led by the psychotic stansfield (gary oldman). mathilda takes refuge in the apartment of her secretive neighbor, leon (jean reno), who takes her in with a certain reluctance. she discovers that leon is a professional assassin, working for tony (danny aiello), a mob kingpin based in little italy. wanting to avenge the death of her brother, mathilda makes a deal with leon to become his protegee in exchange for work as a domestic servant, hoping to learn the hitman's trade and take out the men who took her brother's life. however, an affection develops between leon and mathilda that changes his outlook on his life and career. besson's first american film boasted a strong performance from jean reno, a striking debut by natalie portman, and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by gary oldman. leon was originally released in the u.s. in 1994 as the professional, with 26 minutes cut in response to audience preview tests. those 26 minutes were restored in the director's preferred cut, released in 1996 in france as leon: version integrale and in the u.s. on dvd as leon: the professional in 2000. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "it started as a 1960 roger corman horror comedy, filmed in two days; it then inspired a lavish 1982 broadway musical with music and lyrics by alan menken and howard ashman. finally in 1986, little shop of horrors (1960) graduated into a multimillion-dollar, all-star film musical. rick moranis plays nebbishy seymour krelborn, who works in a rundown flower shop on skid row. while his boss (vincent gardenia) bemoans the lack of business, seymour seeks a way of bringing the shop -- and himself -- fame and fortune. he purchases a strange plant from an even stranger oriental street vendor (vincent wong), naming the plant after his girlfriend audrey (ellen greene, one of the few carry-overs from the broadway version). gradually, seymour learns to his horror that \"audrey ii\" (given the voice of r&b performer levi stubbs) craves blood and flesh. with each of audrey ii's \"feeed meee\"s, seymour must scare up human food to satisfy the plant's appetite. one such victim is dentist steve martin, a leather-jacketed elvis type (the dentist's ultra-masochistic patient played by jack nicholson in the 1960 original is here impersonated by bill murray). the lighthearted tone of the film darkens as audrey ii grows in monstrosity, but the unhappy ending of the broadway version is avoided herein. ~ hal erickson, rovi",

        "description": "frankie dunn (clint eastwood) is a veteran boxing trainer who has devoted his life to the ring and has precious little to show for it; his daughter never answers his letters, and a fighter he's groomed into contender status has paid him back by signing with another manager, leaving frankie high and dry. his best friend and faithful employee eddie dupris is a former fighter who frankie trained. in his last fight, eddie suffered a severe injury, a fact that brings frankie great guilt. one day, maggie fitzgerald (hilary swank) enters frankie's life, as well as his gym, and announces she needs a trainer. frankie regards her as a dubious prospect, and isn't afraid to tell her why: he doesn't think much of women boxing, she's too old at 31, she lacks experience, and has no technique. however, maggie sees boxing as the one part of her life that gives her meaning and won't give up easily. finally won over by her determination, frankie takes on maggie, and as she slowly grows into a viable fighter, an emotional bond develops between them. when a tragedy befalls one of the three characters, each comes to a decision that shows how the relationships in the film have changed them. adapted from a short story by f.x. toole, a former corner man with years of experience in the fight game, million dollar baby also stars morgan freeman, anthony mackie, and mike colter. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "based on the most successful racing video game franchise ever with over 140 million copies sold, dreamworks pictures' \"need for speed\" captures the thrills of the game in a real-world setting. an exciting return to the great car-culture films of the 1960s and '70s, when authenticity brought a new level of intensity to the action, \"need for speed\" taps into what makes the american myth of the open road so enticing. the story chronicles a near-impossible cross-country race against time-one that begins as a mission for revenge, but proves to be one of redemption. in a last attempt to save his struggling garage, blue-collar mechanic tobey marshall (aaron paul)-who with his team skillfully builds and races muscle cars on the side-reluctantly partners with wealthy, arrogant ex-nascar driver dino brewster (dominic cooper). just as a major sale to car broker julia bonet (imogen poots) looks like it will save the business, a disastrous, unsanctioned race results in dino framing tobey for manslaughter.(c) disney",

        "description": "many people wish they could go back to high school, knowing what they know as an adult; josie geller gets the chance to do just that in the comedy never been kissed. josie (played by drew barrymore) is a 25-year-old copy editor at a newspaper in chicago. but it's her youthful looks as much as her journalistic skills that finally win her a writing assignment: she's ordered to enroll in high school posing as a teenager for a story on the state of america's youth. trouble is, josie was a hopeless nerd in high school (called \"josie grossie\" by her classmates); she had no idea of how to fit in with the cool kids, and she's hardly gotten any better at it in the seven years since graduation. while josie makes fast friends with a bookish girl named aldys (leelee sobieski), and also takes notice of her good-looking english teacher mr. coulson (michael vartan), she realizes for the sake of her story she has to infiltrate the cool girls' clique, which will be impossible without someone to give her a crash course in hipness. josie's brother rob (david arquette), obviously the more style-conscious sibling, offers to sign up for the same school to act as the cool-guy friend she'll need to fit in, but just when josie starts making headway (and starts enjoying high school for a change), her editor changes the focus of the story -- he now wants a feature on improper relations between teachers and students, which will not be good for her deepening friendship with mr. coulson. never been kissed also features supporting performances from john c. reilly, molly shannon and jordan ladd (the latter in a much more wholesome vehicle than her last cinematic visit to cinematic teen-town, gregg araki's nowhere). ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "can a beautiful and internationally famous american actress find happiness with a frumpy british bookstore clerk? she can -- at least for a while, it seems -- in notting hill. william thacker (played by hugh grant) is a bookseller at a shop in the notting hill district in west london, who shares a house with an eccentric welsh friend, spike (rhys ifans). one day, william is minding the store when in strolls anna scott (julia roberts), a lovely and well-known actress from the united states who is in london working on a film. she buys a book from william, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. their relationship would logically end there, if william didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. while dashing back to the shop, he bumps into anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. since he lives nearby, william politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since william seems harmless enough, anna agrees. when anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at william's house, they kiss -- just in time for spike to show up. a romance slowly blooms as his friends and family (not to mention the world at large) wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star. notting hill reunites hugh grant with producer duncan kenworthy and screenwriter richard curtis, who previously worked together on the international hit four weddings and a funeral. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "peter gibbons (ron livingston) is a computer programmer working for initech in houston. every day, he and his friends samir (ajay naidu) and michael bolton (david herman as not that michael bolton), suffer endless indignities and humiliations in their soulless workspace from their soulless boss, bill lumbergh (gary cole). for peter, stuck in his cookie-cutter apartment with paper-thin walls and ikea furniture, every day is worse than the one before it -- so every day is the worst of his life. to cap it off, initech has hired a pair of \"efficiency experts\" to downsize the company. one friday night, peter's soon to be ex-girlfriend anne (alexandra wentworth) forces him to go to an occupational hypnotherapist to relieve work stress. while peter is under hypnosis, the therapist keels over and dies. as he never snaps out of his hypnotic state, peter has a new outlook on life. if something annoys him, he just ignores it or walks away from it. he is completely relaxed and enjoying life for the first time in a long time. on monday, peter skips work and sleeps in. he gets up for lunch and drives down to a restaurant next to his office and asks the waitress he's had a crush on, joanna (jennifer aniston), on a date. when peter stops into the office to pick up his organizer, he's called in to talk to the efficiency experts. relaxed and friendly, peter charms them as he describes everything wrong with the office, including his boss. even as peter now appears at work only as the mood strikes him, the experts decide he's management material and give him a promotion even as they lay off the hardworking samir and michael. peter then convinces his friends to exact revenge on initech based upon an idea from superman iii. not everything works out quite as planned. office space originated from writer/director mike judge's first animated short of the same name, created in 1991. the short was about milton (reproduced in the film by stephen root), a damaged office drone whose complaints and threats about his sufferings go unheeded. ~ ron wells, rovi",

        "description": "dutch (arnold schwarzenegger) has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious u.s. government plan in a latin american country. once there, he encounters an old army buddy (carl weathers) who has gotten too deep in the cia's good graces for dutch's comfort. when he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. however, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. soon, the men from dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. why? because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged predator. this carefully paced action movie was given poor reviews by many movie critics, but was sufficiently satisfying for its (largely male) audiences that a successful sequel (predator 2) was released in 1990. ~ clarke fountain, rovi",

        "description": "in 1960, alfred hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense (and perhaps the best-known film director in the world) when he released psycho and forever changed the shape and tone of the screen thriller. from its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel (hardly a common moment in a major studio film in 1960), psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. marion crane (janet leigh) is unhappy in her job at a phoenix, arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager sam loomis (john gavin). one afternoon, marion is given $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. minutes later, impulse has taken over and marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in, and marion decides to stop for the night at the bates motel, where nervous but personable innkeeper norman bates (anthony perkins) cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. there's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film. the first of a handful of sequels followed in 1983, while gus van sant's controversial remake, starring vince vaughn and anne heche, appeared in 1998. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, pulp fiction was widely considered the most influential american movie of the 1990s. director and co-screenwriter quentin tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of david mamet; the serious violence of american gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane, rashomon, and la jetee. the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories, featuring samuel l. jackson and john travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products; bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie; and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel, tim roth, christopher walken, eric stoltz, ving rhames, and uma thurman, whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic. ~ leo charney, rovi",

        "description": "in 1992, reservoir dogs transformed quentin tarantino practically overnight from an obscure, unproduced screenwriter and part-time actor to the most influential new filmmaker of the 1990s. the story looks at what happens before and after (but not during) a botched jewelry store robbery organized by joe cabot (lawrence tierney). mr. white (harvey keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer mr. orange (tim roth) and enjoys showing him the ropes. mr. pink (steve buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. mr. blonde (michael madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. while mr. blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and mr. pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. so who's the rat? what do they do about mr. blonde? and what do they do with mr. orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? reservoir dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in get christie love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "brett ratner directed this action-comedy that found box-office success by teaming chris tucker with jackie chan -- performing his own stunts as per his earlier films. as the story begins, hong-kong supercop lee's (chan), detective savvy leads to the confiscation of $500 million in weapons, drugs, and chinese art. when hong kong chinese consul han (tzi ma), is sent on a diplomatic mission to los angeles, his 11-year-old daughter, soo young (julia hsu), is abducted by an international criminal mastermind. the fbi assures han they will find the kidnappers and return her safely, yet han only trusts his longtime friend and ally (also his daughter's beloved martial arts teacher) inspector lee, who immediately flies in to help. unwilling to have an outsider interfere in their investigation, the fbi assigns rogue lapd detective (and buffoon) james carter (chris tucker) to the case. hoping to impress the fbi, carter enthusiastically reports for work but is dismayed to discover his real mission is only to keep lee away from the case (read b-a-b-y-s-i-t-t-e-r). the arrogant carter reacts by embarking on a one-man crusade to solve the case, but he must first distract lee. it doesn't take carter long before he realizes he has greatly underestimated his hong kong counterpart, who sees what's going on and slips away. impatient fbi agents try to cast off these unwanted misfit cops, but with an assist from lapd bomb expert tania johnson (elizabeth pena), carter and lee eventually confront the bad guys in a full-tilt action sequence. ~ bhob stewart, rovi",

        "description": "director david fincher's dark, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. set in a hellish vision of a new york-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns det. william somerset (morgan freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. but somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot david mills (brad pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. mills has talked his reluctant wife, tracy (gwyneth paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. a diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. first, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. the moody photography is by darius khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist rob bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like the howling (1981). ~ robert firsching, rovi",

        "description": "the hit cable series sex and the city catwalks its way onto the big screen in this feature-film continuation that fans all over have been clamoring for. sarah jessica parker returns once again as carrie bradshaw, the style-maven journalist whose romantic exploits were the key focus of the show. also reprising their roles are kim cattrall, kristin davis, and cynthia nixon, with the series' executive producer michael patrick king taking on writing and directing duties. several years have passed since viewers last saw carrie and company, though she's still involved with mr. big (chris noth) and completely consumed by her obsession for name-brand accessories. meanwhile, miranda is adjusting to married life and motherhood, charlotte is still clinging to her dreams, and samantha and handsome, steely eyed tv star smith jerrod (jason lewis) are now living together out in l.a. of course, when the girls all come together, it's just like old times. dreamgirls' jennifer hudson co-stars as carrie's assistant. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "jack black continues his march to stardom with this typical farrelly brothers blend of broad comedy and a heartfelt message. black is hal larsen, a shallow man rapidly approaching middle age whose superficiality can be attributed to his father's deathbed admonition to only date young, beautiful women. hal and his best friend, mauricio (jason alexander), have taken the advice to heart, but hal finds all of his physically impressive girlfriends consistently lacking in other qualities that would make them ideal mates. when he bumps into self-help guru tony robbins (playing himself), the motivational entrepreneur is intrigued by hal's predicament and hypnotizes him so that he'll only see the inner beauty of women. hal is quickly smitten with rosemary shanahan (gwyneth paltrow), a blonde peace corps volunteer who's tenderhearted, funny, and intelligent. she is also gorgeous and meets hal's basic criteria of outer perfection, but what he doesn't realize is that robbins' spell is working and he cannot see that rosemary actually weights 300 pounds. when mauricio is finally able to snap hal out of his charmed state, hal's in love with the inwardly perfect woman and must overcome his obsession with beauty. the script for shallow hal (2001) was developed when peter farrelly enjoyed the humorous letters written to a mutual friend by sean moynihan, a computer software executive who followed the filmmaker's advice to take up screenwriting. ~ karl williams, rovi",

        "description": "it was called \"disney's folly.\" who on earth would want to sit still for 90 minutes to watch an animated cartoon? and why pick a well-worn grimm's fairy tale that every schoolkid knows? but walt disney seemed to thrive on projects which a lesser man might have written off as \"stupid\" or \"impossible\". investing three years, $1,500,000, and the combined talents of 570 artists into snow white and the seven dwarfs, disney produced a film that was not only acknowledged a classic from the outset, but also earned 8,500,000 depression-era dollars in gross rentals. bypassing early temptations to transform the heroine snow white into a plump betty boop type or a woebegone zasu pitts lookalike, the disney staffers wisely made radical differentiations between the \"straight\" and \"funny\" characters in the story. thus, snow white and prince charming moved and were drawn realistically, while the seven dwarfs were rendered in the rounded, caricatured manner of disney's short-subject characters. in this way, the serious elements of the story could be propelled forward in a believable enough manner to grab the adult viewers, while the dwarfs provided enough comic and musical hijinks to keep the kids happy. it is a tribute to the genius of the disney formula that the dramatic and comic elements were strong enough to please both demographic groups. like any showman, disney knew the value of genuine horror in maintaining audience interest: accordingly, the wicked queen, whose jealousy of snow white's beauty motivates the story, is a thoroughly fearsome creature even before she transforms herself into an ancient crone. best of all, snow white clicks in the three areas in which disney had always proven superiority over his rivals: solid story values (any sequence that threatened to slow down the plotline was ruthlessly jettisoned, no matter how much time and money had been spent), vivid etched characterizations (it would have been easier to have all the dwarfs walk, talk and act alike: thank heaven that disney never opted for \"easy\"), and instantly memorable songs (frank churchill, leigh harline, paul j. smith and the entire studio music department was oscar-nominated for such standards-to-be as \"whistle while you work\" and \"some day my prince will come\").",

        "description": "after incorporating elements of comic book style and design into many of his films, director sam raimi helms this straight-ahead, big-budget comic book adaptation, which also marks acclaimed young actor tobey maguire's first dip into live-action blockbuster filmmaking. spider-man follows the template of the original stan lee/steve ditko source material, with hero peter parker an orphaned, intellectual teen loner living in queens with his aunt (rosemary harris) and uncle (cliff robertson), and dreaming of the girl next door, mary jane (kirsten dunst). on a field trip to a columbia university lab, peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and overnight he gains superhuman strength, agility, and perception. at first, peter uses his powers for material gain, winning a wrestling match with a purportedly lucrative prize. but when peter apathetically fails to stop a burglar from robbing the wrestling arena, a tragedy follows that compels him to devote his powers to fighting crime -- as the superhero spider-man. when he's not busy fighting crime in a spider suit, peter moves into an apartment with his best friend, harry (james franco), and begins work as a photographer at the daily bugle. meanwhile, his do-gooder alter ego finds a nemesis in the form of the green goblin (willem dafoe), a super-powered, megalomaniacal villain who happens to be the alter ego of harry's father, weapons-manufacturing mogul norman osborn. spider-man was written by the prolific blockbuster scribe david koepp (jurassic park, panic room). ~ michael hastings, rovi",

        "description": "your friendly neighborhood web-slinger is back, only this time his sunny outlook has become partially overcast in the third chapter of director sam raimi's spider-man saga. tobey maguire, kirsten dunst, and james franco return to reprise their roles from the previous two installments, with thomas haden church, topher grace, and bryce dallas howard making their first appearances in the series as flint marko (aka sandman), eddie brock (aka venom), and gwen stacy, respectively. peter parker (maguire) has finally leaned to walk the middle ground between being the superhero that his city needs and the man that mary jane (dunst) loves. all is well in new york city until one night, as peter and m.j. sit gazing at the stars, a falling comet streams across the sky and crashes into the ground close by. but this isn't any ordinary shooting star, and upon impact the mysterious space rock is split open to reveal a shape-shifting symbiote with the power to overtake anything that it comes into contact with. later, as harry osborn (james franco) acquires his late father's flying board, engineers a powerful new goblin outfit, and takes to the sky to avenge dad's death, the mysterious space sludge infects both peter's spider-man suit and ambitious street photographer eddie brock (grace). peter's strange new suit gives him a newfound sense of power as it gradually overpowers his personality, and he discovers that escaped convict flint marko was in fact the man responsible for the death of uncle ben (cliff robertson). unfortunately for peter, marko has recently acquired the power to morph at will and quickly completes his transformation into the dreaded sandman. as the sandman gives in to his darkest criminal instincts and the slithering space symbiote transforms eddie brock into the nightmarish fanged villain known as venom, the citizens of new york city must once again call on spider-man to fend off destructive forces that are far too powerful for the likes of mortal man. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "operating under the assumption that by procuring alcohol for an upcoming party they will finally be able to break their longstanding losing streak with the fairer sex, socially inept high school seniors evan (michael cera) and seth (jonah hill) set out to secure the adult beverages that could get them off of the geek list before they even attend college orientation. evan is a bright young student whose outward sweetness belies his suffocating fear of heading off to college without his lifelong best friend seth -- a hormone-driven mischief-maker who wasn't accepted to the same school as evan. but evan and seth both know that college is a place of personal reinvention, and that if they are able to make that first leap together they will have forged a bond powerful enough to last a lifetime. meanwhile, evan and seth's friend fogell (christopher mintz-plasse) acquires a hastily rendered fake i.d. that instantly endears him to a pair of truly irresponsible cops (bill hader and seth rogen). penned by co-star rogen in collaboration with former da ali g show co-writer evan goldberg, the semi-autobiographical superbad was produced by judd apatow and directed by greg mottola -- who previously helmed episodes of undeclared and arrested development. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "a handful of state troopers are put in the uncomfortable position of having to actually enforce the law in this high-spirited comedy. mac (steve lemme), thorny (jay chandrasekhar), foster (paul stoter), and rabbit (erik stolhanske) are four vermont state troopers whose dedication to duty is not exactly an inspiration to law enforcement officers everywhere. stationed in a small town near the canadian border, the troopers don't have much to do, so they while away their hours smoking dope and harassing hapless motorists. their superior officer, capt. o'hagan (brian cox), likes the boys and they try to keep their more outrageous antics out of his earshot, but they often run afoul of fellow trooper farva (kevin heffernan), who insists on doing things by the book. when governor jessman (lynda carter) announces massive budget cuts for vermont law enforcement personnel, things look bad for the troopers and they must quickly prove their worth or they'll be forced to look for real jobs. appropriately enough, the troopers stumble upon some information regarding a group of marijuana dealers operating along the border; the guys figure this is just the sort of high-profile bust that could save their careers, but the police department of a nearby town gets wind of the troopers' plans. the earlville police are no friends of the troopers, and they set out to ruin their moment of glory. super troopers was written by the five-man comedy troupe broken lizard, who also star as the five troopers; the group's leader, jay chandrasekhar, directed. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "the phenomenon of tales from the crypt seems to have no endings, only changes. this successful pun-filled style of presenting ironic horror tales had its beginnings in william gaine's e.c. comic series. at one time, outlandish e.c. comics were at the heart of a national furor over the \"evils\" of comic books, which were thought to lead to moral degeneracy. the big comic-book publishers were frightened into freezing e.c. out of their distribution network, which killed the business. this british movie was based on the tales from the crypt series, which spawned several subsequent movies (and many imitators), at least one television series, and a whole new wave of comic books. released in 1972, this movie has five episodes based on gaines' stories, each introduced by sir ralph richardson as the eerily cheery crypt keeper. his comedic approach to the role was misunderstood at the time, as reviewers expected a more solemn approach to horror. in \"all through the house,\" santa claus is someone to avoid. in \"reflection of death\" it takes some people a while to realize the truth about themselves. in \"poetic justice\" death cannot prevent one man's revenge. the episode \"blind alley\" demonstrates a new use for razor blades. \"wish you were here\" cautions against taking native artifacts lightly (among other things). among the stars featured are peter cushing, joan collins and patrick magee.",

        "description": "a sequel to the sci-fi action thriller that made him and star arnold schwarzenegger a-list hollywood names, writer/director james cameron upped the ante with this follow-up by employing a more sweeping storyline and cutting-edge special effects. linda hamilton returns as sarah connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen john connor (edward furlong), during the late nineties. having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that john will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled armageddon, sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating john in survival tactics and battle strategies. her ranting about humankind's future has landed sarah in an insane asylum and john in the foster care system. the rebellious john has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. when a new and improved terminator android called the t-1000 (robert patrick) arrives from the future to eliminate john, an older model t-800 (schwarzenegger) is sent to protect the boy. the t-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. the t-800 saves john's life and helps break sarah out of the institution. staying only one step ahead of the dogged t-1000, sarah leads her son and the t-800 to the headquarters of cyberdyne systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. there, they attempt to convince inventor miles dyson (joe morton) to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two terminators at a steel foundry. terminator 2: judgment day (1991), which won four oscars in technical categories for its groundbreaking effects, was followed by a short sequel filmed exclusively as an attraction for theme parks, terminator 2: 3-d battle across time (1996). ~ karl williams, rovi",

        "description": "novelist william peter blatty based his best-seller on the last known catholic-sanctioned exorcism in the united states. blatty transformed the little boy in the 1949 incident into a little girl named regan, played by 14-year-old linda blair. suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, regan proves quite a handful for her actress-mother, chris macneil (played by ellen burstyn, although blatty reportedly based the character on his next-door neighbor shirley maclaine). when regan gets completely out of hand, chris calls in young priest father karras (jason miller), who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, father merrin (max von sydow). his foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles. the exorcist received a theatrical rerelease in 2000, in a special edition that added 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the film's original release and digitally enhanced chris newman's oscar-winning sound work. ~ hal erickson, rovi",

        "description": "as the hustler's \"fast\" eddie felson, paul newman created a classic antihero, charismatic but fundamentally flawed, and nobody's role model. a pool player from oakland, ca, as good as anyone who ever picked up a cue, eddie has an achilles' heel: arrogance. it's not enough for him to win: he must force his opponent to acknowledge his superiority. the movie follows eddie from his match against billiards champ minnesota fats (jackie gleason) as he falls in love with sarah (piper laurie), an alcoholic would-be writer and sometime prostitute, and falls under the spell of bert gordon (george c. scott), a successful gambler who offers to take eddie under his wing and teach him how to play in the big time. however, when sarah joins eddie and bert on a trip to louisville for a high-stakes match with a dandy named findlay (murray hamilton), the consequences prove tragic. along with a classic performance by newman, the hustler also features turns by scott, laurie, and gleason, in a rare dramatic role. cameos from pool champ willie mosconi and boxer jake lamotta add to the atmosphere of harry horner's grubby production design and eugen schufftan's camerawork. director robert rossen, who had been working in films since 1937, was to direct only one more film, lilith (1964), before his death in 1966. in 1986, newman returned to the role of \"fast\" eddie in martin scorsese's the color of money, for which he finally earned an academy award as best actor. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "suspense auteur m. night shyamalan takes a break from crafting original screenplays to tell this tale of a 12-year-old boy (noah ringer) who provides the last hope for restoring harmony to a land consumed by chaos. in a world balanced on the four nations of water, earth, fire, and air, people known as the waterbenders, earthbenders, firebenders, and airbenders have mastered their native elements. though the masters can each manipulate their native elements, the only one with the power to manipulate all four elements is a young boy known as the avatar. when the avatar subsequently appears to die while still mastering his powers, the fire nation launches a global war with the ultimate goal of global domination. one hundred years later, two teens discover that the avatar and his flying bison have in fact been locked in suspended animation. upon being freed from his prison, the avatar embarks on an arduous quest to restore harmony among the four war-ravaged nations. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "one of the most popular disney animated musicals, the lion king presents the story of a lion cub's journey to adulthood and acceptance of his royal destiny. simba (voiced first by jonathan taylor thomas, then by matthew broderick) begins life as an honored prince, the son of the powerful king mufasa (voiced by james earl jones). the cub's happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle, scar (voiced by jeremy irons), murders mufasa and drives simba away from the kingdom. in exile, the young lion befriends the comically bumbling pair of pumbaa the warthog (voiced by ernie sabella) and timon the meerkat (voiced by nathan lane), he and lives a carefree jungle life. as he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious scar and reclaim his rightful throne. borrowing elements from hamlet, classical mythology, and african folk tales, the lion king tells its mythic coming-of-age tale with a combination of spectacular visuals and lively music, featuring light, rhythmic songs by elton john and tim rice, and a score by hans zimmer. embraced by children and adults alike, the film also spawned hit songs (\"can you feel the love tonight,\" \"the circle of life\") and a hit broadway musical. in late 2002, the lion king was re-released in the large-screen imax format. ~ judd blaise, rovi",

        "description": "hyperactive mayhem results when a mild-manned banker discovers an ancient mask that transforms him into a zany prankster with superhuman powers in this special-effects-intensive comedy. the wildly improvisational jim carrey plays stanley ipkiss, a decent-hearted but socially awkward guy who one night finds a strange mask. carrey's trademark energy reveals itself after stanley puts on the mask and the banker transforms into the mask, a green-skinned, zoot-suited fireball. the rubber-faced mask possesses the courage to do the wild, fun things that stanley fears, including romancing tina carlyle (cameron diaz). in addition to carrey's physical talents, the film makes effective use of digital visual effects that bestow the mask with superhuman speed, insane flexibility, and popping eyes out of a tex avery cartoon. the larger narrative, involving the efforts of tina's gangster boyfriend to destroy stanley and use the mask's powers for evil, prove less interesting than the anarchic comic set pieces, including a particularly memorable dance number to \"cuban pete.\" the film delivered enough laughs to become a surprise hit and, along with the same year's dumb and dumber, establish carrey's status as a comedy superstar. ~ judd blaise, rovi",

        "description": "a disturbing videotape appears to hold the power of life and death over those who view it in this offbeat thriller. a strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the pacific northwest; it is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. a handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. rachel keller (naomi watts), the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels west with her young son, aidan (david dorfman), a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. rachel turns to her ex, noah (martin henderson), an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery. the ring was adapted from a 1996 japanese film by hideo nakata, which became a massive box-office success in asia and spawned two sequels. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "if john ford is the greatest western director, the searchers is arguably his greatest film, at once a grand outdoor spectacle like such ford classics as she wore a yellow ribbon (1949) and rio grande (1950) and a film about one man's troubling moral codes, a big-screen adventure of the 1950s that anticipated the complex themes and characters that would dominate the 1970s. john wayne plays ethan edwards, a former confederate soldier who returns to his brother aaron's frontier cabin three years after the end of the civil war. ethan still has his rebel uniform and weapons, a large stash of yankee gold, and no explanations as to where he's been since lee's surrender. a loner not comfortable in the bosom of his family, ethan also harbors a bitter hatred of indians (though he knows their lore and language well) and trusts no one but himself. ethan and martin pawley (jeffrey hunter), aaron's adopted son, join a makeshift band of texas rangers fending off an assault by renegade comanches. before they can run off the indians, several homes are attacked, and ethan returns to discover his brother and sister-in-law dead and their two daughters kidnapped. while they soon learn that one of the girls is dead, the other, debbie, is still alive, and with obsessive determination, ethan and martin spend the next five years in a relentless search for debbie -- and for scar (henry brandon), the fearsome comanche chief who abducted her. but while martin wants to save his sister and bring her home, ethan seems primarily motivated by his hatred of the comanches; it's hard to say if he wants to rescue debbie or murder the girl who has lived with indians too long to be considered \"white.\" john wayne gives perhaps his finest performance in a role that predated screen antiheroes of the 1970s; by the film's conclusion, his single-minded obsession seems less like heroism and more like madness. wayne bravely refuses to soft-pedal ethan's ugly side, and the result is a remarkable portrait of a man incapable of answering to anyone but himself, who ultimately has more in common with his despised indians than with his more \"civilized\" brethren. natalie wood is striking in her brief role as the 16-year-old debbie, lost between two worlds, and winton c. hoch's technicolor photography captures monument valley's savage beauty with subtle grace. the searchers paved the way for such revisionist westerns as the wild bunch (1969) and mccabe & mrs. miller (1971), and its influence on movies from taxi driver (1976) to close encounters of the third kind (1977) and star wars (1977) testifies to its lasting importance. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "in 1946, a banker named andy dufresne (tim robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. he's sentenced to a life term at the shawshank state prison in maine, where another lifer, ellis \"red\" redding (morgan freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. the ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to andy: a corrupt warden (bob gunton), sadistic guards led by capt. byron hadley (clancy brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. but andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. he uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. in exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including red. based on a story by stephen king, the shawshank redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter frank darabont. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "\"all work and no play makes jack a dull boy\" -- or, rather, a homicidal boy in stanley kubrick's eerie 1980 adaptation of stephen king's horror novel. with wife wendy (shelley duvall) and psychic son danny (danny lloyd) in tow, frustrated writer jack torrance (jack nicholson) takes a job as the winter caretaker at the opulently ominous, mountain-locked overlook hotel so that he can write in peace. before the overlook is vacated for the torrances, the manager (barry nelson) informs jack that a previous caretaker went crazy and slaughtered his family; jack thinks it's no problem, but danny's \"shining\" hints otherwise. settling into their routine, danny cruises through the empty corridors on his big wheel and plays in the topiary maze with wendy, while jack sets up shop in a cavernous lounge with strict orders not to be disturbed. danny's alter ego, \"tony,\" however, starts warning of \"redrum\" as danny is plagued by more blood-soaked visions of the past, and a blocked jack starts visiting the hotel bar for a few visions of his own. frightened by her husband's behavior and danny's visit to the forbidding room 237, wendy soon discovers what jack has really been doing in his study all day, and what the hotel has done to jack. ~ lucia bozzola, rovi",

        "description": "john carpenter's the thing is both a remake of howard hawks' 1951 film of the same name and a re-adaptation of the john w. campbell jr. story \"who goes there?\" on which it was based. carpenter's film is more faithful to campbell's story than hawks' version and also substantially more reliant on special effects, provided in abundance by a team of over 40 technicians, including veteran creature-effects artists rob bottin and stan winston. the film opens enigmatically with a siberian husky running through the antarctic tundra, chased by two men in a helicopter firing at it from above. even after the dog finds shelter at an american research outpost, the men in the helicopter (norwegians from an outpost nearby) land and keep shooting. one of the norwegians drops a grenade and blows himself and the helicopter to pieces; the other is shot dead in the snow by garry (donald moffat), the american outpost captain. american helicopter pilot macready (kurt russell, fresh from carpenter's escape from new york) and camp doctor copper (richard dysart) fly off to find the norwegian base and discover some pretty strange goings-on. the base is in ruins, and the only occupants are a man frozen to a chair (having cut his own throat) and the burned remains of what could be one man or several men. in a side room, copper and macready find a coffin-like block of ice from which something has been recently cut. that night at the american base, the husky changes into the thing, and the americans learn first-hand that the creature has the ability to mutate into anything it kills. for the rest of the film the men fight a losing (and very gory) battle against it, never knowing if one of their own dwindling number is the thing in disguise. though resurrected as a cult favorite, the thing failed at the box office during its initial run, possibly because of its release just two weeks after steven spielberg's warmly received e.t.the extra-terrestrial. along with ridley scott's futuristic alien, the thing helped stimulate a new wave of sci-fi horror films in which action and special effects wizardry were often seen as ends in themselves. ~ anthony reed, rovi",

        "description": "in this exquisitely made and terrifying new horror film, the age-old concepts of witchcraft, black magic and possession are innovatively brought together to tell the intimate and riveting story of one family's frightful unraveling in the new england wilderness circa 1630. new england, 1630. upon threat of banishment by the church, an english farmer leaves his colonial plantation, relocating his wife and five children to a remote plot of land on the edge of an ominous forest - within which lurks an unknown evil. strange and unsettling things begin to happen almost immediately - animals turn malevolent, crops fail, and one child disappears as another becomes seemingly possessed by an evil spirit. with suspicion and paranoia mounting, family members accuse teenage daughter thomasin of witchcraft, charges she adamantly denies. as circumstances grow more treacherous, each family member's faith, loyalty and love become tested in shocking and unforgettable ways. writer/director robert eggers' debut feature, which premiered to great acclaim at the 2015 sundance film festival - winning the best director prize in the u.s. narrative competition - painstakingly recreates a god-fearing new england decades before the 1692 salem witch trials, in which religious convictions tragically turned to mass hysteria. told through the eyes of the adolescent thomasin - in a star-making turn by newcomer anya taylor-joy - and supported by mesmerizing camera work and a powerful musical score, the witch is a chilling and groundbreaking new take on the genre.",

        "description": "this spectacular epic re-creates the ill-fated maiden voyage of the white star line's $7.5 million r.m.s titanic and the tragic sea disaster of april 15, 1912. running over three hours and made with the combined contributions of two major studios (20th century-fox, paramount) at a cost of more than $200 million, titanic ranked as the most expensive film in hollywood history at the time of its release, and became the most successful. writer-director james cameron employed state-of-the-art digital special effects for this production, realized on a monumental scale and spanning eight decades. inspired by the 1985 discovery of the titanic in the north atlantic, the contemporary storyline involves american treasure-seeker brock lovett (bill paxton) retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman, nude except for a necklace. when 102-year-old rose (gloria stuart) reveals she's the person in the portrait, she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of 84 years earlier. the scene then shifts to 1912 southampton where passengers boarding the titanic include penniless jack dawson (leonardo dicaprio) and society girl rose dewitt bukater (kate winslet), returning to philadelphia with her wealthy fiance cal hockley (billy zane). after the april 10th launch, rose develops a passionate interest in jack, and cal's reaction is vengeful. at midpoint in the film, the titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. even engulfed, cal continues to pursue jack and rose as the massive liner begins its descent. cameron launched the project after seeing robert ballard's 1987 national geographic documentary on the wreckage. blueprints of the real titanic were followed during construction at fox's custom-built rosarito, mexico studio, where a hydraulics system moved an immense model in a 17-million-gallon water tank. during three weeks aboard the russian ship academik keldysh, underwater sequences were filmed with a 35mm camera in a titanium case mounted on the russian submersible mir 1. when the submersible neared the wreck, a video camera inside a remote-operated vehicle was sent into the titanic's 400-foot bow, bringing back footage of staterooms, furniture and chandeliers. on november 1, 1997, the film had its world premiere at the 10th tokyo international film festival. ~ bhob stewart, rovi",

        "description": "lara croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy east london as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father's global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he's truly gone. advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even lara can't understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death. going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her dad's last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of japan. but her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. suddenly, the stakes couldn't be higher for lara, who--against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit--must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. if she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.",

        "description": "a high-energy action adventure based on legend rather than historical fact finds wyatt earp (kurt russell) desiring to retire from law enforcement. with brothers virgil (sam elliot) and morgan (bill paxton), he arrives in tombstone, arizona intending to build his fortune. he discovers that long-time friend doc holliday (val kilmer) is there and that the town is run by a group of brutal outlaws called the cowboys. earp, frustrated with his laudanum-addicted wife, begins a romance with traveling stage actress josephine marcus (dana delany). meanwhile, the cowboys terrorize the citizens of tombstone unchecked. when the town marshal is killed by a cowboy, earp steps in to prevent a lynching by an angry mob. he also refuses to hand the killer over to his fellows, beginning the enmity between the cowboys and the earp brothers. virgil, overcome with guilt at doing nothing to help the tombstone citizens, accepts the position of town marshal. with wyatt and morgan as his deputies, and the help of doc, virgil attempts to arrest several cowboys, resulting in the famous ok corral shoot-out. the cowboys take revenge by ambushing two of the brothers and injuring virgil and killing morgan. the earps leave town, apparently cowed. wyatt returns, wearing the badge of a u.s. marshal, vowing to destroy every last cowboy. he hunts them mercilessly, until the leader, johnny ringo (michael biehn) challenges wyatt to a duel. while not regarded as an artistic masterpiece, \"tombstone\" is considered the best of director george p. cosmatos' prolific films. the all-star cast (including thomas haden church and billy bob thornton in small roles) delivers solid performances. both william a. fraker's cinematography and bruce broughton's stirring musical score are expertly designed for dramatic effect. blood is shown liberally in several key scenes, but seems intended to show that there is nothing glorious in wyatt earp's actions, only necessity. he and his deputies take on the symbolism of the horsemen of the apocalypse -- dispensing judgement, and the biblical references form a symmetry at the beginning and end of the film. ~ lucinda ramsey, rovi",

        "description": "an outlaw finds his life becoming all the more dangerous when he turns against a gang of criminals in this action drama. frank martin (jason statham) is a former special forces officer who lives on the french mediterranean and has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. martin will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous american known as wall street (matt schulze), but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. breaking his own rule, martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful asian woman, lai (shu qi), who is bound and gagged. lai briefly escapes, but martin captures her, and delivers her to wall street as promised. however, after being given a parcel to deliver by wall street, martin finds out what wall street is up to - in partnership with lai's father mr. kwai (ric young), wall street is part of a scheme to smuggle asian illegal aliens into france. martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue lai and put wall street and mr. kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, martin discovers a french detective, tarconi (francois berleand) has gotten wind of his illegal business. the transporter was the first english-language feature for hong kong-based director corey yuen, who along with directing a number of hk action flicks designed fight choreography for several american films. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "ben stiller's satirical look at hollywood, tropic thunder concerns the production of an epic vietnam war film that quickly derails thanks to the giant egos of everyone involved in the production. stiller stars as tugg speedman, an action hero trying to segue out of that genre. jack black plays jeff portnoy, a drug-addicted fat comic also attempting to change his image by taking on such a serious film. they star alongside kirk lazarus (robert downey jr.), one of the world's most awarded actors, and a man who insists on immersing himself totally in a role. in this case, that means lazarus has had his skin dyed in order to portray an african-american soldier. after their outrageous behavior lands the film's director, damien cockburn (steve coogan), in very hot water with producer les grossman (tom cruise), cockburn takes the advice of grizzled vietnam vet four leaf tayback (nick nolte); in order to gain control of his performers, cockburn drops the actors off in the jungle, planning to film the movie guerrilla-style with hidden cameras. when the group stumbles upon a heroin production camp, the actors are unaware that they are in very real danger. ~ perry seibert, rovi",

        "description": "in fine hollywood tradition, john wayne had to play a \"one-eyed fat man\" before the motion picture academy considered him worthy of an oscar. in true grit, wayne plays grumpy, pot-bellied u.s. marshal \"rooster\" cogburn, hired by 14-year-old mattie ross (kim darby) to find tom chaney (jeff corey), who killed her father. the headstrong mattie could have had her pick of lawmen, but selects the aging cogburn because she believes he has \"true grit\" (she talks this way all through the picture, so be prepared). also heading into indian territory in search of chaney is texas ranger la boeuf (glen campbell), who wants to collect the reward placed on the fugitive's head for his earlier crimes. complicating matters are chaney's scurrilous cronies ned pepper (robert duvall), quincy (jeremy slate), and moon (dennis hopper), who have no qualms about killing a troublesome teenaged girl like mattie. while the plot of true grit, adapted (and streamlined) by marguerite roberts from the novel by charles portis, maintains audience interest throughout, the glue that truly holds this western together is john wayne, delivering one of his finest performances (though some believe he was better in she wore a yellow ribbon). wayne's casual charisma is infinitely more effective than the mannered method acting of kim darby and the floundering non-acting of poor glen campbell. and who could not love the climatic face-off between duvall and company and john wayne, whose \"fill your hand, you son of a bitch!\" is not only a classic bit of dialogue, but the apotheosis of the wayne mystique. in 1975, wayne repeated his true grit characterization opposite katharine hepburn in rooster cogburn, but the film failed to match its predecessor and the overall effect was blunted. ~ hal erickson, rovi",

        "description": "tucker & dale vs evil is a hilariously gory, good-spirited horror comedy, doing for killer rednecks what shaun of the dead did for zombies. tucker and dale are two best friends on vacation at their dilapidated mountain house, who are mistaken for murderous backwoods hillbillies by a group of obnoxious, preppy college kids. when one of the students gets separated from her friends, the boys try to lend a hand, but as the misunderstanding grows, so does the body count. tucker & dale vs evil has been a hit on the festival circuit, debuting at sundance, and winning the midnight audience award at sxsw, the jury prize for first feature at fantasia, the best director award at fantaspoa, and the best motion picture award at sitges. -- (c) official site",

        "description": "when bella swan (kristen stewart) reluctantly moved to the perpetually overcast town of forks, wa, and set out to carve a niche for herself, she assumed it would be one similar to the low-profile social position she held back in phoenix. first on the list of surprises was the unfamiliar attention from the male population of her new high school; second, the attention from one male in particular: edward cullen, vampire (robert pattinson). before long, the unlikely soul mates find themselves in a passionate relationship with a variety of significant setbacks, including edward's special-needs diet (he doesn't eat humans, but bella's scent inspires a nearly impossible to harness bloodlust) and the human girl's mortality. though things proceed relatively smoothly at first (edward even introduces bella to his adoptive vampire family), a visiting vampire clan consisting of james (cam gigandet), victoria (rachelle lefevre), and laurent (edi gathegi) catches bella's unique scent and threatens the young couple's budding, if dangerous, happiness. james, known for his powerful tracking ability, becomes obsessed with making bella his next victim. fearing for bella's safety and that of her loved ones, the cullens must combine their collective talents in order to stop the highly predatory james before his goal is accomplished. ~ tracie cooper, rovi",

        "description": "bill paxton, helen hunt and carey elwes may be billed as the stars of twister, but the film's real attractions are the cyclones themselves. best experienced in a theater, the nail-biting, blow-the-audience-out-of-their-seats computer generated graphics, cutting edge sound and other special effects are designed to take viewers straight into the roaring funnel of a gigantic tornado. in order to focus on special effects and action, the story is simple and the characters are drawn in broad strokes with little depth. jo harding (hunt) became a storm chaser (a meteorologist who photographs and scientifically studies tornadoes in the field) after a large twister sucked her hapless daddy into oblivion when she was a girl. bill (paxton) was a storm chaser too, but left to become a successful weatherman. his change of profession ruined his marriage to jo. before separating, the hardings invented dorothy, a gizmo designed to release thousands of tiny sensors when a tornado passes over it. the hardings hope the information transmitted by the sensors will provide insight into the nature of the whirling windstorms. backed by a large corporation, the villainous dr. jonas miller (elwes) has created a similar machine. neither gadget has been field tested and both groups of storm chasers are anxious to find tornadoes. at the peak of the worst twister season in decades, bill shows up at jo's truck with his prissy fiancee melissa (jami gertz) so jo can sign divorce papers. suddenly a twister is spotted. with little hesitation, bill rejoins the mad rush to reach it in time to activate dorothy. jonas and his team are right behind them. throughout the day the storms become worse and the rivalrous race becomes more intense. as they continue facing incredible dangers together jo and bill find renewed love while poor melissa finds only an intense desire to get away from these storm-obsessed lunatics. ~ sandra brennan, rovi",

        "description": "when brothers and fellow fbi agents marcus (marlon wayans) and kevin copeland (shawn wayans) accidentally ruin an otherwise painstakingly executed drug bust, getting back into the good graces of their boss becomes a high-priority assignment in itself. with this in mind, marcus and kevin take on a case far beneath their usual standards when they agree to escort socialite sisters brittany (maitland ward) and tiffany wilton (anne dudek) from a private terminal at jfk airport to their hotel room in the hamptons. once there, two considerably higher-ranking agents will take over the girls' protection. the extra security is no mere perk of wealth, however, as it appears that brittany and tiffany have been targeted by a serial kidnapper. the fbi hopes to apprehend the perpetrator by using the girls as bait, unbeknownst to them. the plan may have worked if it weren't for kevin and marcus, who manage to let the sisters in on the secret. understandably, neither of them want any part in the process, so they force the brothers to come up with a radical solution: with the help of an fbi lab scientist, the very much african-american kevin and marcus will be transformed into two white women who could pass for brittany and tiffany. the agents must keep the charade up long enough to lure the kidnapper, but fooling everyone involved will be the job of their lives. directed by keenen ivory wayans, white chicks also features james king and lochlyn munro. ~ tracie cooper, rovi",

        "description": "mel gibson, long-time heartthrob of the silver screen, came into his own as a director with braveheart, an account of the life and times of medieval scottish patriot william wallace and, to a lesser degree, robert the bruce's struggle to unify his nation against its english oppressors. the story begins with young wallace, whose father and brother have been killed fighting the english, being taken into the custody of his uncle, a nationalist and pre-renaissance renaissance man. he returns twenty years later, a man educated both in the classics and in the art of war. there he finds his childhood sweetheart murron (catherine mccormack), and the two quickly fall in love. there are murmurs of revolt against the english throughout the village, but wallace remains aloof, wishing simply to tend to his crops and live in peace. however, when his love is killed by english soldiers the day after their secret marriage (held secretly so as to prevent the local english lord from exercising the repulsive right of prima noctae, the privilege of sleeping with the bride on the first night of the marriage), he springs into action and single-handedly slays an entire platoon of foot soldiers. the other villagers join him in destroying the english garrison, and thus begins the revolt against the english in what will eventually become full-fledged war. wallace eventually leads his fellow scots in a series of bloody battles that prove a serious threat to english domination and, along the way, has a hushed affair with the princess of wales (the breathtaking sophie marceau) before his imminent demise. for his efforts, gibson won the honor of best director from the academy; the movie also took home statuettes for best picture, cinematography, makeup, and sound effects. ~ jeremy beday, rovi",

        "description": "based on a true story, steven spielberg's schindler's list stars liam neeson as oskar schindler, a german businessman in poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the nazis' rise to power. he starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier itzhak stern (ben kingsley) to help run the factory. by staffing his plant with jews who've been herded into krakow's ghetto by nazi troops, schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. for stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other jews working for schindler. however, in 1942, all of krakow's jews are assigned to the plaszow forced labor camp, overseen by commandant amon goeth (ralph fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. schindler arranges to continue using polish jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. he realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. soon schindler demands more workers and starts bribing nazi leaders to keep jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. by the time germany falls to the allies, schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. schindler's list was nominated for 12 academy awards and won seven, including best picture and a long-coveted best director for spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest american movies about the holocaust. ~ mark deming, rovi",

        "description": "mexican filmmaker guillermo del toro returns to the phantasmagorical cinema that defined such early fare as cronos and the devil's backbone with this haunting fantasy-drama set in the aftermath of the spanish civil war and detailing the strange journeys of an imaginative young girl who may be the mythical princess of an underground kingdom. her mother, carmen (ariadna gil), recently remarried to sadistic army captain vidal (sergi lpez) and soon to bear the cruel military man's child, shy young ofelia (ivana baquero) is forced to entertain herself as her recently-formed family settles into their new home nestled deep in the spanish countryside. as ofelia's bed-ridden mother lies immobilized in anticipation of her forthcoming child and her high-ranking stepfather remains determined to fulfill the orders of general francisco franco to crush a nearby guerilla uprising, the young girl soon ventures into an elaborate stone labyrinth presided over by the mythical faun pan (doug jones). convinced by pan that she is the lost princess of legend and that in order to return to her underground home she must complete a trio of life-threatening tasks, ofelia sets out to reclaim her kingdom and return to her grieving father as vidal's housekeeper mercedes (maribel verd) and doctor (alex angulo) plot secretly on the surface to keep the revolution alive. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "this crowd-pleasing medieval adventure tale is very loosely inspired by geoffrey chaucer's the canterbury tales and mixes the anachronistic elements of modern-day rock music and colloquialisms with a period setting and characters. heath ledger stars as william thatcher, a low-born 14th century squire who, in a fit of inspired spontaneity, replaces his deceased employer as the competitor at a jousting competition. jousting is a pastime only permitted to knights, who are of noble birth, but thatcher wins and decides to continue his new pursuits. with the help of his two fellow squire friends wat and roland (alan tudyk and mark addy) and none other than the gambling-addicted geoffrey chaucer (paul bettany), thatcher has soon adopted a false identity and is winning one joust after another on his way to a championship in london. his victories inspire the affection of a female fan, jocelyn (shannyn sossamon), and the ire of a competitor, count adehmar (rufus sewell), but thatcher's ruse is threatened with exposure. a knight's tale is the sophomore directorial effort of acclaimed screenwriter brian helgeland, who won an oscar for his work on l.a. confidential (1997) and debuted behind the camera with the troubled production of payback (1999). ~ karl williams, rovi",

        "description": "anne rice's best-selling romantic horror tale about the origins of a centuries-old vampire inspired this popular, atmospheric chiller. one of director neil jordan's major hollywood productions, the film stays close to its source material, retaining the frame of a young reporter (christian slater) interviewing a man who claims to be a 200-year-old vampire. the man, louis (brad pitt), shares his story, beginning in 18th-century new orleans with his first encounters with the charismatic and decadent vampire lestat (tom cruise). lestat converts louis to blood-sucking and immortality, but louis fails to adopt lestat's cavalier attitude, instead tormenting himself with guilt over his new nature. the two vampires remain deeply, if reluctantly, connected over the years, while becoming intimately involved with others of their kind, including claudia (kirsten dunst), a mature immortal in a young child's body. fans of the novel raised numerous objections, particularly after rice initially spoke out against the casting of cruise as lestat; further casting difficulties followed the death of river phoenix, whose role as the interviewer was assumed by christian slater. rice later recanted her objections, and the combination of thrills and gothic romance proved popular with audiences. ~ judd blaise, rovi",

(the drift king) his first time on the road, sean is subsequently forced to work under expatriate han (sung kang) to pay off his debt after failing to cross the finish line first. taking note of the young american's affinity for racing as he warmly welcomes him into his merry band of misfit drift-fanatics, han slowly introduces sean to the key principles of the popular new racing style. when sean makes the potentially deadly mistake of falling for d.k.'s girlfriend neela (nathalie kelley), he'll need all the help he can get to face his most challenging race to date and take on the most notorious driver on the tokyo drift scene in a hair-raising, hairpin-turn race where the winner truly takes all. ~ jason buchanan, rovi",

        "description": "from director makoto shinkai, the innovative mind behind voices of a distant star and 5 centimeters per second, comes a beautiful masterpiece about time, the thread of fate, and the hearts of two young souls. the day the stars fell, two lives changed forever. high schoolers mitsuha and taki are complete strangers living separate lives. but one night, they suddenly switch places. mitsuha wakes up in taki's body, and he in hers. this bizarre occurrence continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. yet, somehow, it works. they build a connection and communicate by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint. when a dazzling comet lights up the night's sky, something shifts, and they seek each other out wanting something more-a chance to finally meet. but try as they might, something more daunting than distance prevents them. is the string of fate between mitsuha and taki strong enough to bring them together, or will forces outside their control leave them forever separated?",
